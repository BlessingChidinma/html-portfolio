<h2>MY TOP 3 MOVIES OF ALL TIME</h2>
<hr>
<h3>JUMONG</h3>
<P>This is one of my favourite and first Kdrama.I love jumong because it is as good as it gets,The movie is a loose dramatization of korean history and the effort of jumong
to unite the kingdom and then drive out invaders. The character development here is truly awesome. it is a mix of suspense and drama</p>
<h3>LEGEND OF THE SEEKER</h3>
<P>There is plenty of action and excitement,a good bit of magic and the occasional monster.With amazing characters</p>
<h3>ATTACK OF TITANS</h3>
<P>This is one of my favourite Anime.It just gets better every season. Its one those shows that makes you asks questions,divulge into theories about morals and ethics</P>
